## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/obi.git
cd obi
npm install
```

---

## Launching the App

### Development (local)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reload. Use this during development.

### Production (local)

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Builds an optimised bundle then serves it. Always test this before deploying.

---

## Deployment

### Vercel (recommended)

The fastest option — Vercel is purpose-built for Next.js.

**Option A — CLI:**
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

**Option B — GitHub import:**
1. Push your repo to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Import the repo — Vercel auto-detects Next.js and deploys in ~1 minute

Free tier is generous and includes preview deployments on every push.

---

### Other Platforms

| Platform | Steps |
|---|---|
| Netlify | Connect GitHub repo → build command `npm run build`, publish dir `.next` |
| Railway | `npm i -g @railway/cli` then `railway up` |
| Docker | See below |

### Docker

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

```bash
docker build -t obi .
docker run -p 3000:3000 obi
```

---

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Missing dependencies
npm install

# Port already in use
npm run dev -- -p 3001

# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next && npm run dev
```

---

## Key Flows

### Withdrawal (`/withdraw`)

1. **Account** — select source account
2. **Amount** — enter amount (validated against balance + max limit of $50,000)
3. **Review** — summary of amount, fee ($2.50), and total
4. **Verify** — OTP confirmation (demo code: `123456`)
5. **Success** — confirmation screen with link to transaction history

### Payment Transfer (`/payment-transfer`)

1. **From** — select source account
2. **To** — enter recipient details; choose local (Ghana) or international bank
3. **Amount** — enter amount; select transfer speed (instant $1.50 / standard free) or international wire ($15.00)
4. **Review** — full transfer summary
5. **Verify** — choose OTP delivery (SMS or email); enter code (demo code: `482916`)
6. **Success** — confirmation with transaction reference

---

## Shared Components

### `<Stepper steps currentStep color />`

Renders a horizontal step progress bar. Accepts an array of `{ id, label }` step objects, the current active step id, and an accent color hex.

### `<ActionButton onClick disabled label />`

Primary branded button (yellow `#fff498` background). Used for all forward-navigation CTAs.

### `<BackButton onClick label? />`

Outlined secondary button for back/edit navigation. Label defaults to `"Back"`.

### `<SummaryRow label value highlight? />`

A single label/value row for review screens. Set `highlight` to `true` for the total row (renders with accent border).

---

## Security Notice

A persistent banner is rendered at the top of every page:

> **Secured** — No official representative will ever request your password, PIN, OTP, or card details.

This is a UI/demo safeguard. In production, pair this with proper auth (e.g. NextAuth, Clerk) and server-side validation.

---

## Demo Credentials

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Withdrawal OTP | `123456` |
| Transfer OTP | `482916` |

All account data is seeded into `localStorage` on first load and persists across sessions.

---

## Customisation

- **Banks** — edit `LOCAL_BANKS` and `INTERNATIONAL_BANKS` arrays in `payment-transfer/page.tsx`
- **Fees** — adjust `TRANSFER_FEE`, `INTL_FEE`, and `WITHDRAWAL_FEES` constants
- **Brand color** — the accent yellow (`#e6dc00` / `#fff498`) is applied inline via `style` props and Tailwind `yellow-*` classes
- **Fraud line number** — update the number in the security banner inside `app/(root)/layout.tsx`
